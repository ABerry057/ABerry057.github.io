## Excerpts of Illustrative Documents

### *Bolshevism: A Curse & Danger to the Workers* by Henry William Lee (1919)

**75.53%** of this document is composed of the "Revolutions" topic.

#### Except

*The Bolshevist Government has now dominated the central portion of
European Russia for more than a twelvemonth. It bases its demand for
general recognition on the fact that it has lasted a year without
being overturned, and contends that that proves it has the support of
"Soviet" Russia. The brief statement of internal conditions at Moscow
and Petrograd made above suggests that the reports of terrible food
shortage in those great cities, which come from independent sources,
are not entirely destitute of foundation. And yet the apologists of
the Bolsheviks here assure us that in Russia at the present time we
have a "Socialist Republic of a very high order"!*

### *The Genius* by Margaret Horton Potter (1906)

**83.11%** of this document is composed of the "Revolutions" topic.

### Excerpt

*But unhappily, though scandal scarcely raised its head among the sincere
members of the youthful army, other ills as far-reaching and even more
dangerous began soon to sow seeds of evil and of suffering among them.
For out of the fermentation arising among these isolated bands, came the
bitterest drink that Russia has had to swallow. Poverty, alienation,
the common cause against a common enemy--how should it not breed
socialism? That established, where find a lack of bolder spirits to take
the short step into downright anarchy? Whether it was Turgeniev or
Lermontoff who first interpreted this infant Credo, what matters it? As
in a night, lo! on every lip was the dread word that was destined to be
blazoned in bloody letters at the head of the next and grimmest chapter
of all Russian history: Nihilism.*

*Indeed, indeed, had these young men and women found their little
knowledge a deeply dangerous thing! Too quickly they perceived the
imperfections of their government, the corruption rife among the
officials of every class. And bitter was their reproach. The question to
them seemed simple. To correct this, at once and forever, dig up the
very soil in which the corruptive roots expanded--here was the way, the
only way. And immediately there followed pamphlets and articles. Secret
meetings, propagandist organizations, flooded the land. And the red flag
was everywhere raised and acknowledged as the student symbol.*

## Potential Historical Connections

Of course, the October Revolution, which took place on 7 November 1917, was a major turning point in both Russian and world history, and had a significant impact on perceptions of Russia in the English-speaking world. Included in this project's corpus, there are texts that give tempered praise the new Soviet experiment, such as Betrand Russell's *The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism* (1920), to those that decry the new political order, such as John Spargo's *"The Greatest Failure in All History" A Critical Examination of the Actual Workings of Bolshevism in Russia* (1920), and even those that describe American military intervention in Russia to oppose the revolution, such as *The History of the American Expedition Fighting the Bolsheviki, Campaigning in North Russia 1918-1919* (1920).
