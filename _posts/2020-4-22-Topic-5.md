## Excerpts of Illustrative Documents

### *Napoleon's Campaign in Russia, Anno 1812; Medico-Historical* by Achilles Rose (1913)

**82.79%** of this document is composed of the "War" topic.

#### Excerpt

*The French had entered Moscow. The first word of Napoleon to Mortier, whom
he had named governor of Moscow, was "no pillage!" But this point of honor
had to be abandoned. The 100 thousand men who had entered were troops of
the Ã©lite, but they came starving at the end of their adventurous
expedition. During the first days they walked the streets in search of a
piece of bread and a little wine. But little had been left in the cellars
of the abandoned houses and in the basements of the little shops, and with
the conflagration there was almost nothing to be found. The Grand Army was
starving as much almost as on the march. Dogs which had returned in
considerable numbers to lament on the ruins of the houses of their masters
were looked upon as precious venison. The uniforms were already in rags,
and the Russian climate made itself felt. These poor soldiers, poorly clad,
dying from starvation, were begging for a piece of bread, for linen or
sheepskin, and, above all, for shoes. There was no arrangement for the
distribution of rations; they had to take from wherever they could, or
perish.*

### *Trapped in 'Black Russia': Letters June-November 1915* by Ruth Pierce (1918)

**23.59%** of this document is composed of the "War" topic.

#### Excerpt

*Extra pontoon bridges are thrown across the Dnieper, ready for the
retreat of the Russian troops. Though there are lines of trenches and
barbed-wire entanglements before the city, no effort will be made to
defend it, as it would probably mean its destruction. I wonder what the
Germans will do when they get here? They are human beings, but I can't
help but think of Belgium, and then I am sick with fear. At other times,
it seems the one way to bring our affair with the Secret Service to a
finish. How strange it will be to have no longer a Russian army between
the Germans and Kiev. No more a wall of flesh to protect us. Poor
soldiers, without a round of ammunition, fighting with naked hands. They
will cross the Dnieper to one side of the city, crowding, fighting,
falling together. And the German cannon driving them on, and crashing
into the city, sometimes, wiping out whole streets of townspeople. And
then, the gray lines of the Germans running into Kiev. The thousands of
blue-eyed Germans and their pointed helmets and guttural speech taking
possession of everything.*

## Potential Historical Connections

The two featured documents highlight the preoccupation English-language authors had with the numerous military conflicts in the Russian Empire in the early 20<super>th</super> century, such as the First World War, and the continued interest in the military conlicts of the previous decade, such as the Napoleonic invasion of Russia in 1812.
